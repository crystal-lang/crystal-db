module DB
  # Methods to allow querying a database.
  # All methods accepts a `query : String` and a set arguments.
  #
  # Three kind of statements can be performed:
  #  1. `#exec` waits no record response from the database. An `ExecResult` is returned.
  #  2. `#scalar` reads a single value of the response. A union of possible values is returned.
  #  3. `#query` returns a `ResultSet` that allows iteration over the rows in the response and column information.
  #
  # Arguments can be passed by position or as an array.
  #
  # ```
  # db.query("SELECT name FROM ... WHERE age > ?", age)
  # db.query("SELECT name FROM ... WHERE age > ?", args: [age])
  # ```
  #
  # Convention of mapping how arguments are mapped to the query depends on each driver.
  #
  # Including `QueryMethods` requires a `build(query) : Statement` method that is not expected
  # to be called directly.
